### Recent achievements
#### March 2023
🥇 Winner: "Cloud Fever - A Hackathon with Novo Nordisk"
> Hands-on experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS): Gathered large-scale biomedical data from different sources (using AWS Glue & AWS Athena). The data was processed (in Data Wrangler) and used to train and deploy a machine learning model (in AWS SageMaker) to predict the best wet laboratory configuration for a set of input parameters. The prediction were displayed in a React Frontend hosted in an AWS S3 bucket.
